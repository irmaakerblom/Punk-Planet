        <h1>Reflections on Redesigning the Magazine Page</h1>
        <p>1: The parts of recreating the page that were easy were the paragraphs. It was easy to make the text in to separate paragraphs and also making some parts in bold.</p>
        <p>2: The more challenging parts were mainly using the tables to get two columns, it was especially difficult to get the margins and spacing between the paragraphs and pictures to look like the magazine. It was also quite difficult to ad the images in the beginning.</p>
        <p>3: Some parts were not possible to recreate. It wasn't possible to make the page look like an A4 completely like the magazine. I think in general the layout was not possible to get exactly like the magazine even though I tried with different widths of both the table, the cells and the pictures. </p>
